<p> System: Ubuntu18.04</p>

<p> This is a very basic instructions on how to install OpenCV-contrib for ROS </p>

<p> Although OpenCV already provides a handful of wonderful functions, the OpenCV-contrib has many more functions that deserves a try. </p>

<p> While it may not be so much of a problem to install OpenCV and OpenCV-contrib, it seems to be more complicated when you are trying to install OpenCV-contrib if you already have OpenCV installed because ROS already has installed it for you.</p>

<p> Why is it difficult? </p>

<p> The <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html">OpenCV-contrib install guide</a> assumes that OpenCV is not installed. So for the common newbies to Linux and cmake, building OpenCV-contrib has just to many unknowns. Should you uninstall OpenCV and install OpenCV with contrib?</p>

<p> ROS installs OpenCV by itself, and uninstalling OpenCV may create problems. So this may be a dangerous route to take.</p>

<p> Then what is the proper way? </p>

<p> The overall method is to install OpenCV and OpenCV-contrib version 3.2 (since ROS melodic for Ubuntu 18.04 installs version 3.2). You're going to reinstall OpenCV entirely, but in the folder that ROS already installs for you. So, we are going to overwrite the OpenCV folder that was created by ROS. For my case, I have my OpenCV installed in "/usr/include/opencv2." So keeping this in mind, we can start the install process.</p>

<p> I recommend using the cmake-gui since it is more intuitive with the install options. </p>

	<b>sudo apt install cmake-gui</b>

<p> After selecting where the source code and the build directory is - usually the build file is just below the source file "../source/build" - you can select how you want to configure the options for your build. We are going to check the following options: </p>

<p> 1. CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE -> Release </p>
<p> 2. OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH -> PATH_TO_YOUR_DOWNLOAD_FILE/opencv_contrib-3.2.0/modules </p>
<p> 3. CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX -> /usr/ 
If you have OpenCV installed in the /usr/include/ space, not the /usr/local/ space, you will proceed as /usr/ </p>
<p> 4. ENABLE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS -> OFF (untick) 
According to <a href="linkref">this reference</a>, if this option is not off, the compile will report back errors.</p>
<p> 5. CUDA.. thing may also need to be unticked.
That's how I did it for mine. But this may not allow CUDA compatability. </p>

<p> Now, click "Generate" and the build is done.</p>

<p> Then, compile and install OpenCV</p>

	<b> cd PATH_TO/opencv-3.2.0/build </b>

	<b> make </b>

	<b> sudo make install </b>

<p> Now you are done! </p>
