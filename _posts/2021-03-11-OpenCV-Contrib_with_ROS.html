<p> System: Ubuntu18.04</p>

<p> This is a very basic instructions on how to install OpenCV-contrib for ROS </p>

<p> Although OpenCV already provides a handful of wonderful functions, the OpenCV-contrib has many more functions that deserves a try. </p>

<p> While it may not be so much of a problem to install OpenCV and OpenCV-contrib, it seems to be more complicated when you are trying to install OpenCV-contrib if you already have OpenCV installed because ROS already has installed it for you.</p>

<p> Why is it difficult? </p>

<p> The <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html">OpenCV-contrib install guide</a> assumes that OpenCV is not installed. So for the common newbies to Linux and cmake, building OpenCV-contrib has just to many unknowns. Should you uninstall OpenCV and install OpenCV with contrib?</p>

<p> ROS installs OpenCV by itself, and uninstalling OpenCV may create problems. So this may be a dangerous route to take.</p>

<p> Then what is the proper way? </p>

<p> The overall method is to install OpenCV and OpenCV-contrib version 3.2 (since ROS melodic for Ubuntu 18.04 installs version 3.2). But we are going to overwrite the OpenCV folder that was created by ROS. For my case, I have my OpenCV installed in "/usr/include/opencv2." So keeping this in mind, we can start the install process.</p>

<p> I recommend using the cmake-gui since it is more intuitive with the install options. </p>

	<b>sudo apt install cmake-gui</b>

<p> After selecting where the source code and the build directory is - usually the build file is just below the source file "../source/build" - you can select how you want to configure the options for your build. We are going to check the following options: </p>

<p> 1. CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE -> Release </p>
<p> 2. OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH -> PATH_TO_YOUR_DOWNLOAD_FILE/opencv_contrib-3.2.0/modules </p>
<p> 3. CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX -> /usr/ 
If you have OpenCV installed in the /usr/include/ space, not the /usr/local/ space, you will proceed as /usr/ </p>
<p> 4. ENABLE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS -> OFF (untick) 
According to <a href="linkref">this reference</a>, if this option is not off, the compile will report back errors.</p>
<p> 5. CUDA.. thing may also need to be unticked.
That's how I did it for mine. But this may not allow CUDA compatability. </p>

<p> Now, click "Generate" and the build is done.</p>

<p> Then, compile and install OpenCV</p>

	<b> cd PATH_TO/opencv-3.2.0/build </b>
	<b> make </b>
	<b> sudo make install </b>

<p> Now you are done! </p>
