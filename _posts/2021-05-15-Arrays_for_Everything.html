## Addition 




<p> Heaps are not referring to the computer memory allocated area. It is a tree structures where each node has children of smaller value.  like this perhaps as shown below. (draw all basic structures of heaps). </p>

### C++ STL heaps 

<p> In C++, they are binary max heaps. 
* Binary: 2 children per node 
* Max: the larger the value the closer to the root

So a binary tree structure (like this image) would turn into a std::vector<int> (like this image).

In the link above, there is no object created called `std::heap<int>` or anything like that. 

Q. What does this mean? 
A. A heap is a vector type just sorted in descending order (largest comes first) 

Q. If heaps are just in descending order, what is the time complexity of inserint a value in the middle? 
A. Not good probably? right?

Q. `is_heap()` function checks whether the container is heap or not.  (check this (link)[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heap-using-stl-c/])
A. Since the heaps aren't a separate class, this is just checking if the vector follows a max heap structure which is just sorting a vector in descending order, right?

Q. `is_heap_until()` function returns the position of where the container no longer follows the heap rule: descending order (or ascending). Then, what is a good use case of this?
A.  </p>
